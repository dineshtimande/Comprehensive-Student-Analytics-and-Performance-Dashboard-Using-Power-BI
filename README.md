# Comprehensive-Student-Analytics-and-Performance-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI

ðŸ“Œ **Overview**

This project is a comprehensive student analytics dashboard designed to visualize and analyze various academic and engagement metrics for a group of students. It leverages a dataset containing student details such as demographics, academic performance, attendance, departmental information, scholarship awards, extracurricular participation, and research contributions. The dashboard facilitates insights into trends, outliers, and group characteristics, enabling data-driven decision-making for educational institutions.

ðŸŒŸ **Features**

-	Dynamic Visualizations: Line charts, pie charts, stacked bar charts, and summary metrics for instant insight into enrolment patterns, attendance, GPA trends, and engagement.
-	Multi-dimensional Analysis: Drill down by age group, gender, department, city, and country.
-	Filter Controls: Interactive filters for job status, gender, and attendance status enable focused queries and scenario analysis.
-	Academic and Engagement Tracking: Monitor student achievements in GPA, attendance, extracurricular involvement, research publications, and scholarship distribution.
-	Geographic and Institutional Insights: Visual analytics per city and country to support outreach and policy planning.

ðŸ“‚ **Dataset**

The primary dataset contains comprehensive student profiles, including:
-	Demographics: Full Name, Age, Gender, Country, City
-	Academic Details: Department, Semester, Join Date, GPA, Attendance
-	Student Engagement: Extracurriculars, Research Papers
-	Financial Support: Scholarship amount, On-Campus Job status
-	Custom Bins: Age Group and Attendance Status (for segmentation analysis)

ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning and Transformation**

1.	Data Import: Gather data from institutional sources (CSV/Excel/Database).
2.	Missing Data Handling: Impute missing values and standardize categorical fields.
3.	Type Consistency: Convert dates to uniform datetime format and ensure numeric precision for GPA/attendance/scholarship.
4.	Feature Engineering: Create age groups, attendance bins, and summary activity scores.
5.	Outlier Review: Detect and manage outliers to maintain analytic quality.
6.	Export: Store the cleaned dataset for reproducibility and dashboard input.

ðŸ§° **Tools and Technologies**

-	ðŸ“Š Power BI: Dashboard creation and visualization.
-	ðŸ§  DAX / M Language: Calculated columns, measures, logic modelling.
